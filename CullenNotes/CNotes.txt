List of tasks needed to be done:
-Adjust camera
	-find best possible angle
	-every player is being followed
	-not clipping everywhere / going too far away or close
-Sweep through assets folders and make sure it is as organized as possible
	-Not having 6 different clunk models and not knowing which ones are which
	-Maybe putting all of the character stuff in one folder. Not having models and character prefabs separate
-Clean playerController script
	-Was out of control from last time I worked on this
-Revisit documentation
	-Log how things are programmed and the systems etc.
	-ex: the limb damage system.
-Combat
	-Only deal actual damage if performing attack animation (anim event bool?, anim event on first idle frame resetting it)
	-Look at damage values and continue tweaking






-switch strike to attacking state
-player attacking launched anim event bool saying they are attacking
-player being hit checks on collision of the bool is true, and if so, will lose health.
